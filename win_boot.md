Seem to have less issues with RTX 3060 compared to RTX 4070 SUPER. Stuttering and nvlmddmkm errors in Event Viewer.

- UEFI boots into 2560 x 1440p with RTX 4070 SUPER and 4K with RTX 3060, which is weird behaviour > auto switch to 4K takes a while but happens
- - maybe something with drivers

- missing Internet Edge

[ ] CMOS reset
[ ] DDU driver reinstall
